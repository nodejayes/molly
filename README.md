# Molly

The goal of Molly is to create services that are as flexible and easy to configure as possible. Based on the schemata of models, a service will be created which will allow you to save, read, edit and delete these models. By adding further freely definable functions, a higher flexibility is achieved. The application possibilities of Molly Services are manifold and range from monolithic service to microservice architecture.
